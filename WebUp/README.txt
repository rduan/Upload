The Brief.

You have been given a project to send some customer data to a 3rd party API

Environmental Versatile Intuitive Logistics Inc (EVIL inc)
http://evilapi.afdcloud.com.au/

The brief is as follows:
1. Build a .NET web app where a user can upload the data file
2. Send ALL the data in the file to the API one line at a time
3. Check the data to make sure it is uploaded
4. Show the user the results of the upload
5. Upload your code to a git repository (github / bitbucket)
6. Email Peter Willmott a link to the repo (and provide access if not public)

The CSV file contains the Customer and Value data for the upload call. The
Action is "order created", File is the name of the uploaded file, and the
Property value is your name.

An example file "customerdata.csv" is included in this zip.

Your manager has described the team over at Evil as "A great bunch, but a 
little sulphory", and has recommended that you use an asynchronouse approach
as their API has been patchy at times. As always your manager is hoping you
can show him something new and interesting.
